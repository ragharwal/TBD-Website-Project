        Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language 
        to connect existing components together. Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse. The Python interpreter and the extensive standard 
        library are available in source or binary form without charge for all major platforms, and can be freely distributed.

        Often, programmers fall in love with Python because of the increased productivity it provides. Since there is no compilation step, the edit-test-debug cycle is incredibly fast. Debugging Python programs is easy: a bug or bad input will never cause a segmentation fault. Instead, when the interpreter
        discovers an error, it raises an exception. When the program doesn't catch the exception, the interpreter prints a stack trace. A source level debugger allows inspection of local and global variables, evaluation of arbitrary expressions, setting breakpoints, stepping through the code a line at a 
        time, and so on. The debugger is written in Python itself, testifying to Python's introspective power. On the other hand, often the quickest way to debug a program is to add a few print statements to the source: the fast edit-test-debug cycle makes this simple approach very effective.

      Artificial intelligence (AI), the ability of a digital computer or computer-controlled robot to perform tasks commonly associated with intelligent beings. The term is frequently applied to the project 
      of developing systems endowed with the intellectual processes characteristic of humans, such as the ability to reason, discover meaning, generalize, or learn from past experience. Since the development
      of the digital computer in the 1940s, it has been demonstrated that computers can be programmed to carry out very complex tasks—as, for example, discovering proofs for mathematical theorems or playing 
      chess—with great proficiency. Still, despite continuing advances in computer processing speed and memory capacity, there are as yet no programs that can match human flexibility over wider domains or 
      in tasks requiring much everyday knowledge. On the other hand, some programs have attained the performance levels of human experts and professionals in performing certain specific tasks, so that 
      artificial intelligence in this limited sense is found in applications as diverse as medical diagnosis, computer search engines, and voice or handwriting recognition.

         Machine learning is an application of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning focuses on the 
         development of computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves.

          The process of learning begins with observations or data, such as examples, direct experience, or instruction, in order to look for patterns in data and make better decisions in the future based on the examples that we 
          provide. The primary aim is to allow the computers learn automatically without human 
          intervention or assistance and adjust actions accordingly.

          But, using the classic algorithms of machine learning, text is considered as a sequence of keywords; instead, an approach based on semantic analysis mimics the human ability to understand the meaning of a text.

        C++ is an object-oriented computer language created by notable computer scientist Bjorne Stroustrop as part of the evolution of the C family of languages. C++ is pronounced "see-plus-plus." 
        It was developed as a cross-platform improvement of C to provide developers with a higher degree of control over memory and system resources.

      Some call C++ “C with classes” because it introduces object-oriented programming principles, including the use of defined classes, to the C programming language framework. Over time, C++ has 
      remained a very useful language not only in computer programming itself, but in teaching new programmers about how object-oriented programming works. However, it does not support only 
      object-oriented, but also procedural and functional. Thanks to its high flexibility and scalability, C++ can be used to develop a broad range of software, applications, browsers, Graphical 
      User Interfaces (GUIs), operating systems, and games.

      Today C++ is still very appreciated for its notable portability which allows developers to create programs that can run on different operating systems or platforms very easily. Despite being 
    a high-level language, since C++ is still close to C it can be used for low-level manipulation due to its close relation with machine language.

        SQL has remained a consistently popular choice for database users over the years primarily due to its ease of use and the highly effective manner in which it queries, 
        manipulates, aggregates data and performs a wide range of other functions to turn massive collections of structured data into usable information.

        For this reason, it has been incorporated into numerous commercial database products, such as MySQL, Oracle, Sybase, SQL Server, Postgres and others. In fact, many 
        non-relational databases like MongoDB and DynamoBD are called NoSQL products due to their lack of SQL programming.

        While different iterations of SQL may utilize different syntax for key operations, in general, basic commands like select, insert, update and create are common to 
        all SQL releases. This makes it very easy for someone with a basic knowledge of SQL to work in many different environments and perform a wide variety of tasks.
